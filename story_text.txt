----------- Intro ------------

Opportunity, nicknamed "Oppy", was launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed on Mars on January 25, 2004.

It was woken up with a selected musics playlist (also available on spotify as "Opportunity, wake up!"), which included "Wake Me up Before you Go-Go", "(We're Gonna) Rock Around The Clock", "Dust in the wind", "Space oddity", and many others. 

With a mission planned duration of 92.5 Earth days, Oppy exceeded its operating plan by 55 times its designed lifespan, meaning 14 years and 46 days (in Earth time).

Due to the planetary dust storm on Mars, Oppy ceased communications on June 10, 2018, and entered hibernation two days later.

On February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the Opportunity mission was complete, after the spacecraft had failed to wake up to over 1,000 calls sent from earth since August 2018.

This is its final moments before the storm...
